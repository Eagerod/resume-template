# Resume Template

This is a LaTeX project that I built in the interest of being able to manage the design of my resume separately from the content.

It's set up to allow for users to create their CV and their resume in the same document, and to have the ability to choose how much content to include in a given output document by modifying the `\cvtrue` line in `resume.tex`
