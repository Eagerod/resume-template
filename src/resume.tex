% This document is the template I use when building out resumes when friends or
%   family ask for help building out their resumes. It tends to have a
%   complete-enough quality to it, that allows for specializing, or enhancing
%   sections when needed, but is generally sufficient using just the base
%   template.
% The content in the template is meant to be nothing more than a format-aware
%   Lorem Ipsum. In places where short lists were needed, they were used, and
%   silly content, or generally nonsensical content was used, as long as the
%   format of the content fit with expectations of that section.
% Note: The subheader right now is tailored for a software-focused career path,
%   but that can easily be changed by modifying or removing the left-most
%   minipage in the subheader.tex file.

\subsection*{Other Experience}
\begin{description}
    \item[Sleep] Although I do have professional experience sleeping, it is also a hobby of mine.
        I have been sleeping as a hobby for most of my professional life.
    \item[Silly Talks] A lot of my professional career has revolved around speaking, so on the side, I've also become somewhat of a silly-talker.
        Although I don't have any professional experience as a deep-talker, it is something that I've got a lot of experience in, and can hold my own in a deep-talk-off.
    \item[Management] Although the experience doesn't come from a professional setting, I manage a guild in the recent hit game Talk Mania X.
        I rally individuals from around the world to talk together 5 times a week so we can defeat the evils of silence.
